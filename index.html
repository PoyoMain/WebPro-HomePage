                <p>Hello! I'm Chris! I'm a senior at Georgia State University majoring in Computer
                    Science. This is my homepage which is where all my interests, coursework, and any
                    accomplishments will be. </p>
                <p>I enjoy challenging myself to try new things while also refining my current skills
                    as well. Currently I'm doing a lot of game development stuff and that is where my current
                    focus lies, but I've also taken an interest to web development and UI/UX design. </p>
                <p>I would like to pursue game development as a full time career in the future. It would be
                    nice to either be a member of an indie studio or start an indie studio, but I would also
                    be happy working for a bigger game company.</p>

                    <h3>Puzzles</h3>
                    <p>I really like doing jigsaw type puzzles. I dont do them all that
                        often, but they're pretty calming to do and I can listen to music
                        or have something playing in the background while I do them. Playing
                        puzzle video games is really fun too.

                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>I do a lot of work in the Unity game engine making video games, whether it
                        be for personal projects or for club. Its fun making all sorts of different
                        projects and designing systems for other people to play and have fun with.

                    <h3>Reading</h3>
                    <p>Although its been a bit busy to do so recently, I enjoy reading. Whether its
                        like a novel, comic, or manga, I like getting invested in them and reading for
                        hours on end. Mystery is my favorite genre, so I generally stick to that for mainly
                        everything I read, but branching out sometimes is nice too.

                    <h3>Movies</h3>
                    <p>I really like watching movies. I have to same preference for mystery movies that I do
                        with books. A few years back I like watched a minimum of 1 movie a day for a year and
                        ended up with 473 movies watched that year. My favorite movies are Wall-E, Wolf Children,
                        Iron Giant, Sixth Sense, and Django Unchained. Silence of the Lambs and Shutter Island are
                        really good too.

                    <p>I just like to eat. Not really much more to say about this one. Went to a sushi buffet
                        for the first time recently and it ended up being so delicious. It was called Sushi Bros.

                    <h3>Video Games</h3>
                    <p>I like playing video games. Its been too busy to play too many recently but they're really
                        fun to play. Two of my favorites are Hollow Knight and Celeste, both have gotten more than
                        one playthrough from me. I love metroidvanias in general.
